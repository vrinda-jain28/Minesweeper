ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (OPTIONAL):

It is also advisable to alter the size = width, height variable in line 20 of both the BasicAgentGameplay.py as well
as the ImprovedAgentGameplay.py. The ratio between width:height is set to 3:2, and we found that 1050:700 is ideal for
smaller displays (13-inch laptop display) and 1800:1200 is ideal for larger size displays (27-inch monitor).
